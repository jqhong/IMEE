The host is a Ubuntu 14.04, 64-bit linux-3.13.11-ctk. Follow step 1-3 to install and re-compile the host's kernel. 
1. Use linux_3.13.0.orig.tar.gz and linux_3.13.0-106.153.diff under release to get
the host's kernel source code. Install the kernel from the source code. If you already have an installed linux-3.13.11-ctk and its source code, ignore this step.
2. Copy the *.c and *.h files in kvm/ into the kernel source tree, the corresponding paths are indicated in kvm/README. Add $(KVM)/imee.o before $(KVM)/kvm_main.o into the file arch/x86/kvm/Makefile under kernel source tree. 
3. Run ./dep.sh under kernel source tree to re-compile and re-install kvm.ko and kvm_intel.ko. 

The guest is a 32-bit linux kernel, there is no modification on the Guest kernel. 

scan_tool_sync/src/main.c contains the source code of VMI app. scan_tool_sync/lib/hyp.c contains the source code of imee agent. 
4. make under scan_tool_sync/ to generate executable imee. Run ./imee 0x0 to start introspecting kernel objects from target guest VM.
